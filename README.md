This stencil is a blend of the older Lync 2010 stencils with the newer Lync 2013 images. The main reason for creating these stemmed from layman having trouble making sense of the new clean lines we find representing our architecture (in particular the servers). Also some favourites have been included like the SIP gateways commonly used and also some shapes from the new templates.

## Revision History
